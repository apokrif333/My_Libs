corrects some errors and provides some additional information and explanation the clipper chip technical summary dorothy denning revised april 1993 introduction april the president announced new initiative that will bring together the federal government and industry voluntary program provide secure communications while meeting the legitimate needs law enforcement the heart the plan new tamper proof encryption chip called the clipper chip together with split key approach escrowing keys two escrow agencies are used and the key parts from both are needed reconstruct key chip contents the clipper chip contains classified single key bit block encryption algorithm called skipjack the algorithm uses bit keys compared with for the des and has rounds scrambling compared with for the des supports all des modes operation the algorithm takes clock ticks and electronic codebook ecb mode runs mbits per second each chip includes the following components the skipjack encryption algorithm bit family key that common all chips bit serial number this length subject change bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip the chips are programmed mykotronx inc which calls them the myk the silicon supplied vlsi technology inc they are implemented micron technology and will initially sell for about each quantities 000 more the price should drop the technology shrunk micron encrypting with the chip see how the chip used imagine that embedded the telephone security device will suppose call someone and both have such device after pushing button start secure conversation security device will negotiate bit session key with the device the other end this key negotiation takes place without the clipper chip general any method key exchange can used such the diffie hellman public key distribution method once the session key established the clipper chip used encrypt the conversation message stream digitized voice the telephone security device feeds and into the chip produce two values the encrypted message stream and law enforcement field which are transmitted over the telephone line the law enforcement field thus contains the session key encrypted under the unit key concatenated with the serial number all encrypted under the family key the law enforcement field decrypted law enforcement after authorized wiretap has been installed the ciphertext decrypted the receiver device using the session key chip programming and escrow all clipper chips are programmed inside scif secure compartmented information facility which essentially vault the scif contains laptop computer and equipment program the chips about 300 chips are programmed during single session the scif located mykotronx the beginning session trusted agent from each the two key escrow agencies enters the vault agent enters secret random bit value into the laptop and agent enters secret random bit value these random values serve seeds generate unit keys for sequence serial numbers thus the unit keys are function 160 secret random bits where each agent knows only generate the unit key for serial number the bit value first padded with fixed bit block produce bit block and are then used keys triple encrypt producing bit block similarly padded with two other bit blocks produce and and two additional bit blocks and are computed and are then concatenated together giving 192 bits the first bits are assigned and the second bits the rest are discarded the unit key the xor and and are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow agencies sequence values for and are generated they are written onto three separate floppy disks the first disk contains file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part the second disk similar but contains the values the third disk contains the unit keys agent takes the first disk and agent takes the second disk thus each agent walks away knowing bit seed and the bit key parts however the agent does not know the other bits used generate the keys the other bit key parts the third disk used program the chips after the chips are programmed all information discarded from the vault and the agents leave the laptop may destroyed for additional assurance that information left behind the protocol may changed slightly that four people are the room instead two the first two would provide the seeds and and the second two the escrow agents would take the disks back the escrow agencies the escrow agencies have yet determined but they will not the nsa cia fbi any other law enforcement agency one both may independent from the government law enforcement use when law enforcement has been authorized tap encrypted line they will first take the warrant the service provider order get access the communications line let assume that the tap place and that they have determined that the line encrypted with the clipper chip the law enforcement field first decrypted with the family key giving documentation certifying that tap has been authorized for the party associated with serial number then sent via secure fax each the key escrow agents who return also via secure fax and and are xored together produce the unit key and decrypted get the session key finally the message stream decrypted all this will accomplished through special black box decoder capstone the next generation successor the clipper chip called capstone the government and myk mykotronx has already been developed will include the skipjack algorithm the digital signature standard dss the secure hash algorithm sha method

for immediate release april 1993 statement the press secretary the president today announced new initiative that will bring the federal government together with industry voluntary hum vlsi and mykotronx are industry wonder what happened ibm this should right their street and mandateed scheme voluntary orwell would love this program improve the security and privacy telephone communications while meeting the legitimate needs law enforcement telephone encryption and scrambleing are years behind digital ones like rsa idea even des the above while literaly true clasic straw man claim the context non real time circuits such mail and the like the initiative will involve the creation new products accelerate the development and use advanced and secure telecommunications networks and wireless communications links would modestly propose that mandated use isdn would more for commun ications than this lot for too long there has been little dialogue between our private sector and the law enforcement community resolve the tension between economic vitality and the real challenges protecting americans rather than use technology accommodate the sometimes competing interests economic growth privacy and law enforcement previous policies have pitted government against industry and the rights privacy against law enforcement sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years protect electronic funds transfer now being used protect electronic mail and computer files while encryption normmaly des technology can help americans protect business secrets and the unauthorized release personal information also can used terrorists drug dealers and other criminals note the use the word business the above the whole tenor this release seems establishing ground rule that only business use legitimate for debate you want the nothings you drop your wife ear remain secret and private that not even the agenda for debate note that there role for you contain private info this the only reference information already the hands others the unauthorized release bit also drawing long bow most these cases are people who have legitimate access abusing and revealing often selling the info these people are course this proposal the people who will have the keys the criminals also use lawers courts the cia white house officials and pens about their business when will they outlawed well yeah several them would better idea than clipper them again the protections law and the courts have been seriously erroded over the last decade ofr state the art microcircuit called the clipper chip has been developed government engineers the chip represents nsa new approach encryption technology yeah this bit very true can used new relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can attached ordinary telephone scrambles telephone communications using encryption algorithm that more powerful than many commercial use today note the repeated mixing telephone scrabeling and encryption demo the above claim ordanary pots would good nights entertainment suspect note also the many not all the general tone implies this new technology will help companies protect proprietary information protect the privacy personal phone conversations and prevent unauthorized release data transmitted electronically the same time this technology preserves the ability federal state and local law enforcement agencies intercept lawfully the phone conversations criminals the case record seems indicate that what needed brutal tightening the current abuses have not heard yet case that was impeaded the use secure encryption the men black the other side abuse law enforcers well documented even govt agencies and the phone other coms blurred yet again key escrow system will established ensure that the clipper chip used protect the privacy law abiding americans key escrow system will established ensure that the clipper chip used protect the privacy law abiding americans lets run that line twice not very carefully what says the stated purpose the key eschrow make the use clipper compulsory note the word ensure protect law abiding will leave you the person who asked included the outlawing other encryptions the answer this press release yes each device containing the chip will have two unique keys numbers that will needed authorized government agencies decode messages encoded the device when the device manufactured the two keys will deposited separately two key escrow data bases that will established the attorney general access these keys will limited government officials with legal authorization conduct wiretap just they only can wiretap now with warrent the clipper chip technology provides law enforcement with new authorities access the content the private conversations americans just makes sure that the illegal ones are preserved demonstrate the effectiveness this new technology the attorney general will soon purchase several thousand the new devices addition respected experts from outside the government will offered access the confidential details the algorithm assess its capabilities and publicly report their findings where you find many experts any kgb people looking for contract and later posting asks what the stu iiis they already have will very interesting see the military and embasies start use after all secure isn the govt will answer that point its own actions the chip important step addressing the problem encryption dual edge sword encryption helps protect the privacy individuals and industry but also can shield criminals and terrorists need the clipper chip and other approaches that can both provide law abiding citizens with access the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using hide their illegal activities order assess technology trends and explore new approaches like the key escrow system the president has directed government agencies develop comprehensive policy encryption that accommodates the privacy our citizens including the need employ voice data encryption for business purposes again personal use seems unaskable question the ability authorized officials access telephone calls and data under proper court other legal order when necessary protect our citizens warrents are not always needed seems the effective and timely use the most modern technology build the national information infrastructure needed promote economic growth and the competitiveness american industry the global marketplace and the need companies manufacture and export high technology products the itars seem slightly impeed this the president has directed early and frequent consultations with affected industries the congress and groups that advocate the privacy rights individuals policy options are developed the administration committed working with the private sector spur the development national information infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer technologies give americans unprecedented access information this infrastructure high speed networks information superhighways will transmit video images hdtv programming and huge data files easily today telephone system transmits voice note that all this wonderfull stuff will secret only the proper people will able express opinion hence only the desired result will emerge since encryption technology will play increasingly important role that infrastructure the federal government must act quickly develop consistent comprehensive policies regarding its use the administration committed policies that protect all americans right privacy while also protecting them from those who break the law encryption and codes have been around for millenia they are generaly equilibrium with the technology the time the systematic study cyphers has resulted swing favor the encrypter the moment have doubt that the factoring problem will fall time probably fofr practical purposes the middle the next century further information provided accompanying fact sheet the provisions the president directive acquire the new encryption technology are also available for additional details call mat heyman national institute standards and technology 301 975 2758 questions and answers about the clinton administration telecommunications initiative does this approach expand the authority government agencies listen phone conversations clipper chip technology provides law enforcement with new authorities access the content the private conversations americans suppose law enforcement agency conducting wiretap drug smuggling ring and intercepts conversation encrypted using the device what would they have decipher the message they would have obtain legal authorization normally court order the wiretap the first place they would then present documentation this authorization the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and obtain the keys for the device being used the drug smugglers the key split into two parts which are stored separately order ensure the security the key escrow system who will run the key escrow data banks the two key escrow data banks will run two independent entities this point the department justice and the administration have yet determine which agencies will oversee the key escrow data banks little hard critisise non proposal how strong the security the device how can sure how strong the security this system more secure than many other voice encryption systems readily available today note drop back phone mode again this true answer can rephrased sucks big time anyone who can drive the crypt work bench will use for light amusement before breakfast while the algorithm will remain classified protect the security the key escrow system this link between the security the key eschrow and the actual algorithm real winner given that have secret bit numbers could someone please explain how the details encryption algorithm will reveal them are willing invite independent panel cryptography experts evaluate the algorithm assure all potential users that there are unrecognized vulnerabilities just make sure you read the cvs real carfully whose decision was propose this product the national security council the justice department the commerce department and other key agencies were involved this decision this approach has been endorsed the president the vice president and appropriate cabinet officials quick with out looking back what name missing from that list who was consulted the congress industry have going discussions with congress and industry encryption issues and expect those discussions intensify carry out our review encryption policy have briefed members congress and industry leaders the decisions related this initiative the people who agree with and who think there buck for them will the government provide the hardware manufacturers the government designed and developed the key access encryption microcircuits but not providing the microcircuits product manufacturers product manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip manufacturer that produces them the reverse engineering provisions the mask work act could relevent here who provides the clipper chip mykotronx programs their facility torrance california and will sell the chip encryption device manufacturers the programming function could licensed other vendors the future how buy one these encryption devices expect several manufacturers consider incorporating the clipper chip into their devices you don not unless you are one the right people the administration were unable find technological solution like the one proposed would the administration willing use legal remedies restrict access more powerful encryption devices this fundamental policy question which will considered during the broad policy review the key escrow they missed the word secret here needs grammar lesson too mechanism will provide americans with encryption product that more secure more convenient and less expensive than others readily available today but just one piece what must the comprehensive approach encryption technology which the administration developing would say less secure less conveniant more expensive pgp free less available and more prone being comprimised proofs the contarary will welcome note proof the administration not saying since encryption threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement will prohibit outright some countries have effectively done nor the saying that every american matter right entitled unbreakable commercial encryption product they don seem saying anything that makes much sense and this proposal does prohibit except very limited way and this the one explicit reference personal rights denial and yes don think that the mexicans brazilians and canucks are included clinton als magnanamous gesture there false tension created the assessment that this issue either proposition rather both concerns can and fact are harmoniously balanced through reasoned balanced approach such proposed with the clipper chip and similar encryption techniques the false tension false the balance between two repugnant points the right privacy hand waved non existance putting behind the false assessment assumed that the removal the right take what ever steps you deem suitable protect your privacy non negotiable hence defined the govenment language non existant you don agree you must criminal only criminals don agree with out laws also note the non question what here was not possible what does this decision indicate about how the clinton administration policy toward encryption will differ from that the bush administration indicates that understand the importance encryption technology telecommunications and computing and are committed working with industry and public interest groups find innovative ways protect americans privacy help businesses compete and ensure that law enforcement agencies have the tools they need fight crime and terrorism indicates know that bush dropped the ball squashing that nasty insert suitable retoric and will stamp out this disorderly unruley outbreak freedom and ultra national sentiment will the devices exportable will other devices that use the government hardware voice encryption devices are subject export control requirements case case review for each export required ensure appropriate use these devices the same true for other encryption devices one the attractions this technology the protection can give companies operating home and abroad with this mind expect export licenses will granted case case basis for companies seeking use these devices secure their own communications abroad plan review the possibility permitting wider exportability these products this one real giggle australia france they will have reveal the keys and the algorithm don think the top list things must have the restrictions will

happening here the situation getting totally blown out proportion post was referring your regular patrolman car cruising around the city gang members course the police have access the things that you mentioned but they use tanks and such all the time course they don and that the point was trying make every day when out lunch always see cops coming the majority that see are still carrying revolvers not that there anything wrong with revolver but you cop that against some gang member with couple automatics his coat mean semi auto handguns you going disadvantage even with training have been shooting range where gang gang members were practicing shooting they were actually practicing taking out their guns quick possible and shooting the target and they weren doing too badly either the university cops here who are are state cops are armed better than the chicago police seems most state cops are every city and suburban police officer seen around the twin cities the last two years has carried semi auto some type different brands though haven seen any glock with regard this discussion are getting dangerously far from the usual rantings and close the realm but like put two cents worth while there nothing wrong with revolver especially large frame 357 magnum favorite there are valid advantages semi autos suggest reading massad ayoob know some people can stand him and think full bull but think that general his material very valid and useful book _the semi auto pistol police work_ something like that defines number ways that semi auto are different and that different good the main advantage not increased firepower but more accurate followup shots when you single action mode there also certain propriatory nature each gun that takes some familiarity learn this may have diminished with time more criminals become familiar with different models semi autos but was cited stopping least slowing down criminals who had grabbed police officers gun define armed better shoot revolver and semi auto like the colt does one fires faster than the other nope aside from which faster rate fire usually not desirable sure makes the other guys duck for cover but just you trying hitting anything with thompson hose mode this why the military limiting now round burst fire simple semi auto would better but the troops like able rock and roll even wasteful ammo something often short supply when the enemy plentiful revolver equally capable semi auto the same caliber revolver also has the advantage that misfires you just pull the trigger again double action revolver almost all them can hand cocked first but will fire merely pulling the trigger yes but this best done with two hand hold with single hand you either pull the gun far off target cock must fire double action the semi auto has the same advantages plus always after the first shot misfire revolver merely means you must pull the trigger again rotate the next round not sure this meant different from your first point semi auto you can pull the trigger again try dropping the hammer the same round advantage you don have revolver where the next trigger pull will always the next round discussing this point now this fine with dud but what about hangfire situation granted very rare but your round will now off confined the cylinder with place slingshotting the slide misfire takes very little time revolver can carried with the 6th chamber empty and under the hammer for maximum safety but still can drawn and fired with easy motion even one handed actually with modern revolver designs incorporating hammer blocks this not necessary usually recommended revolver would have fall hard enough and the right angle actually break the hammer and driver the firing pin into the round set off speedloaders for revolver allow reloads almost fast magazines semi autos can faster depending users the best speedloader users especially those using the spring loaded speed loaders are very fast problem that ejecting the spent cases two handed job where dropping the expended magazine one handed this means that while you can inserting fresh magazine soon the old one clears the gun with speed loader you have through more motions that will always take more time you also don have the advantage tactical reloads replacing partial magazine bring you back full capacity the partial magazine can still used needed later misfire semi auto will require you clear jammed shell first time spent which can fatal and vital second often lost you realize hey jammed before starting anything about clearing yes the time recognize the problem just important the time clear really though either revolver semi auto the odds actual misfire with factory ammo are awfully small you are more likely get jam semi auto but even these are exceptionally rare with modern quality guns sigs glocks most semi autos must have the slide worked chamber the first round and cock the hammer some police carry their semi autos with the chamber loaded and hammer cocked but safety engaged not consider this safe however you must trade off safety get the same speed employment revolver there are some double action semi autos out there but the complexity operation many them requires more training all common semi auto can carried with round their chamber without any safety problems while put that out statement that believe should say that this applies all the ones looked for the semi different from the revolver situation the guns all have hammer firing pin blocks they also have safety because there real advantage carrying one these cocked and locked you have the same safety and speed employment revolver plus the advantage followup shots not familiar with semi autos except for the 1911 admit that was initially skeptical about carrying this cocked and locked but after examining the design trying defeat the safeties gun unloaded course and shooting lot see inherent safety problems with especially thumbreak holster with the strap under the hammer this design also gets you more speed for accurate first shot than revolver some police departments switched glocks and then started quietly switching many officers back the old revolvers too many were having accidents partly due the poor training they received not that glocks require rocket scientists but some cops are baffled something complex the timer vcr yeah the infamous glock still can figure out how worse than revolver for safety you don pull the trigger doesn off imagine that all your revolver shooting was done double action then you could pull the glock trigger far enough fire before you realized addition you had developed that nasty habit keeping your finger the trigger when holstering your gun and relying your thumb the hammer remind you take off before you blew off your foot then you have problems when the hammer wasn there anyone who goes anyone saying that the criminals obviously outgun the police don know nothing about firearms turn off cops and hunter and pay attention not seek here say semi autos are junk merely that assuming they are better for all jobs stupid cop with revolver his hip and shotgun the rack more than equipped for anything short riot think this even okay for riot long small one gun control hitting what you aim you whip out wonder nine and fire real fast you may find you don hit anything good controlled fire from revolver more likely get you hit own 9mm beretta myself but consider inferior carry weapon something like the ruger security six revolver haven hit what aiming the first shots something quite seriously wrong somewheres while might like having the backup capacity those extra shots certain cases overwhelmingly the shots fired criminal encounters less than have the poor man beretta taurus and consider inferior carry weapon the springfield oops 9mm arguments are relegated you are right though you don hit what you aim then the shooter gun combination has failed don ascribe failures the the fire real fast with wonder nine scenario you mention the gun this shooter failure whether through lack discipline lack training what crooks overwhelmingly use crime why the same nice simple revolvers that the police often use well actually some police prefer the much heftier 357 magnum but anyway 9mm are becoming more popular with crooks too though the does still lead the list and like said around here semi auto seem the rule for the street cop don know about the state patrol however they may still carry the highway patrolman obplea don flame prefer semi autos for most things but they introduce unneccessary complications something nerve wracking abrupt encounter with lone criminal vincent please don take any this flame just whoops looks more like worth and much imho but check ayoob book

puck threw the net got good carom and ended behind the goalie the second nylander goal got three whacks the puck before went this the most frustrating part the flyers defense take the body and they get one shot and beat you fine don give them another chance carkner galley and mcgill are all terrible about this bet money least one them was the closest flyer the play that all have radio got bad after that and was lucky know who was that scored much less how from what heard roussel had very strong game after the game gene hart asked bobby taylor pick the three stars the season rather than the game was garry galley for his career high point total surprised that former goalie wouldn look closer his defensive play tommy soderstrom for his team record tying shutouts only about season and mark recchi for his all time high team single season scoring mark but here the odd part couldn decide between lindros and recchi for number picks recchi after had hard time choosing between him and lindros doesn that make lindros what you wanna know three stars the season well since you asked eric lindros eric dominates game simply stepping out onto the ice the difference between the team record with him and without him accident believe that the team could have been almost successful without recchi there question that this team significantly better with eric lindros and think that will deservedly wear the his jersey next season tommy soderstrom shutouts was second the league only belfour and tommy didn have chris chelios booo front him also didn play complete season due heart problems sentimental edge here family has history heart problems there question mind that tommy soderstrom this teams goalie the future and roussel complains again about being number look for him traded within years mark recchi again you can argue with all time team high single season scoring mark there are awful lot teams that didn have single player get many points plus mark the only flyer play the entire season not tough choice honorable mentions rod brind amour topped his single season high point total which set last year the difference was that wasn the top line this year and didn get much playing time then again didn get the defensive attention that got last year from the other team either dimtri yushkevich was the teams most consistent defenseman yes made rookie mistakes but was usually fast enough make for them have feeling that with his shot score few more points next year without giving anything his own zone and suspect that the teams top defenseman years come garry galley was the team point leader from defensemen again there are some things you just can argue with and battled with chronic fatigue syndrome certainly deserves kudos for only missing one game and that was against his wishes under doctors orders but his defensive play often negates his offensive contribution little more caution and little bit smarter his own end will make him much more important part the team next year brent fedyk was the leagues biggest improvement over last years point total but consistency became problem for him couple misc notes mostly for mailing list members tom misnik member the mailing

like this have had believe one mass murder the last twenty years not going say don have our gun problems but have the world largest undefended boarder with one the most gun happy countries the world think canada illustrates that gun control does have effect fact suprising that there any difference considering how easy smuggle gun from the yes amazing isn fact should tell you that gun control not the reason your crime rate low since any idiot can smuggle guns into canada from the any time think paul was trying make the point that any idiot doesn there are surely some idiots who smuggle guns but paul seems feel that the exis tence stricter gun control laws has had deterrent effect this seems strange argument make considering that canada violent crime rate general far lower than that the our non gun crime rate greater than their entire crime rate would seem strange suggest that were the result gun control laws think looked find very specific cultural and enforcement reasons why the non gun rate low well and then that reasons could applied the with gun rates easily given that most criminally used guns are either legally purchased stolen from those who purchase them legally having more restrictions legal possession does seem have the effect reducing gun related crimes aside from the fact that find the idea being punished because somebody might steal something from and and commit crime with silly solution still doesn address the question canada which now the way blaming their rising gun crime rate the strange that the border used magically keep the guns out but now isn certainly makes sense that would well makes sense some anyway the other side the coin course that far illegal drugs are purchases legally stolen from people who purchase them legally still not been convinced that guns commodity which criminals have shown their perfectly willing pay for from illegal sources stolen either from police military civilian wouldn simply see south american sources from which drugs come start smuggling guns well since there thriving gun manufacturing industry down there you would just look little closer the crime statistics you would realize that our non gun crime rate also very high guns per are not the issue directly contradicted the nejm study that compared crime seattle and vancouver the non gun rates were roughly the same for both cities the difference violent crime rates was almost totally gun related and was not pointed out the study but critiques two seperate articles james wright and david kopel come mind was pointed out that the difference was also almost entirely minority related that the gun crime rate skyrocketed for poor minorities blacks and hispanics primarily while when you compared the white majority they were virutally identical the problem with the nejm study was they compared minority non minority percentages but failed take into account the relative conditions those minorities that there was eqaul percentage nomn whites was about far they went they failed take into account that the non whites either city were not living the same conditions the situation was entirely based availability guns then expect that the white rates the two groups which are arguably fairly comparative the two cities would have far higher rate seattle yet the majority seattle not only not significantly higher when the minorities are excluded but slightly lower violent crime highly concentrated the inner city surprise pick the area with the highest incidence poverty drug use disease etc since rates are lower suburbia middle class folks can ignore the problem the point course that many the inner city problems are not mirrored canada such there condition which significantly different canada from the and violent crime highly correlated that area suggesting that gun control the source canada low rate highly questionable one canadian pointed out talk politics guns canada major gun control 1978 did not result either reduction slowing increase violent crime rates which have been rising steadily since apparently they didn even mirror the very large drop violent crime the early eighties most violent crime occurs areas with strict gun control already post hoc ergo propter hoc those areas implemented gun control because the high rates true only certain extent take washington where gun control was instituted while had crime problems true but that crime proceeded explode afterwards similarly for new york the question not simply point time where crime was high low did the gun control significantly and positively impact violent crime since gone those areas often faster than was going before you can simply dismiss the high crime rate saying gun control was caused yes gun control may instituted deal with high crime but the crime not positively impacted you can continually say that that crime rate was entirely cause that gun control since much that crime rate increased after gun control was implemented just happened canada similar worse rates exist cities with poor gun control would expected violent crime was generally independent gun control and the jury still out the question whether recent tough laws washington may have alleviated violence and suicide rates there would this the laws which made manufacturers liable for what others did with their guns and suddenly the police found nobody would sell

lost when posted make things worse lost own copy have asked the sharks mailing list which did get out see someone can mail copy back someone responds will repost when get otherwise will write day two and post sorry about that larry depalma season 3rd acquired free agent from minnesota grade netter fan watching the sharks including knows where depalma was the end the season the sharks appeared still have his rights but wasn san jose wasn kansas city and his name hasn appeared the waiver wire and that kind invisibility was prevalent for the most part for depalma after being called october against the tampa bay lightning depalma had excellent week scoring points games while playing good defense unfortunately the year old depalma then disappeared the rest the way getting just more points more games and generally looked lethargic and uninterested both ends the ice then was sent down kansas city walked out from there and was suspended and later reinstated when was revealed that was injured then promptly disappeared from the watching eyes shark bytes the mailing list now known sharks officials faithful and neither the sharks nor miss him johan garpenlov season 3rd acquired trade with detroit for bob mcgill and 8th round pick entry draft from vancouver grade after early slump garpenlov was nothing short inspirational the rest the way finishing with points games second highest total the team clicked well with team mvp kelly kisio and right wing rob gaudreau kisio got most the credit but garpenlov finishing second the mvp voting clearly demonstrated his playmaking and scoring skills was seen making excellent centering passes well finishing passes him putting the puck past opposing goaltenders getting club high power play goals contrary his previous rep garpenlov also showed that despite his small size 183 lbs was willing throw himself around when necessary albeit not very successful yet also still needs work his defense although improved tremendously throughout the season and was actually quite good penalty killer the end the season will major key the offense next year david bruce season 5th acquired from louis expansion draft grade after banner when led the team power play goals and was third total scoring points games bruce was bothered virtually all this season with groin injury which kept him out the lineup for all games this season course difficult speculate how well would have done this season had not been affected the injury but the year old bruce was effective with man man short the sharks first season and was expected strong offensive leader this season well the injury appears serious which shame because otherwise may have much brighter future for now instead his future with the sharks next season appears clouded mark pederson season 3rd acquired trade with philadelphia for dave snuggerud grade difficult for understand the flyers decision unload pederson after very good offensive season last season points games but after riding the pine early the season pederson was summarily sent the sharks exchange the defensive minded snuggerud and finished with games combined with the flyers and the sharks was also limited injuries this season and this limited his production points but when healthy pederson appears impressive with good scoring touch good size and the willingness throw around although not considered physical forward and good speed also does not appear liability defense but the sharks probably have wait until next season see how much exactly pederson can john carter season 4th acquired free agent from boston grade carter was definitely one the hardest workers the team and the hard work worked wonders times looked great ice however although did look great times the fact that received just points games for his efforts sign that there only much his hard work can and the sharks confirmed that sending him kansas city with about games left the season carter who will turn may always hussled but result was sometimes trapped too deep within the offensive zone while forechecking but was generally credit the defensive end but probably limited utility that capacity and did not impress offensively although was one the best sharks drawing penalties very unlikely back next season jean francois quintin season 1st acquired from minnesota dispersal draft grade don understand why the sharks didn let quintin play any more than the games played this season was generally hard working and creating opportunities offensively and appeared age ready for regular nhl duty least for team like the sharks finishing with points those games while not being defensive liability shoulder injury training camp before the season limited quintin the team leading scorer exhibition games despite sitting out the final two just games with the sharks and the blades that season but looked impressive should solid contender for regular duty next season mark beaufait season 1st acquired 2nd round pick 1991 supplemental draft grade after all star season kansas city beaufait got cup coffey with the sharks late the season when the blades knocked down playoff spot and the sharks decimated with injuries playing games and scoring goal for his only nhl point thus far despite small size 165 lbs beaufait was not shy throw himself around when necessary and looked pretty good times although too early judge him based nhl games which played mostly left wing away from his center position northern michigan and kansas city jaroslav otevrel season 1st acquired 8th round pick 1991 entry draft grade like beaufait otevrel also played away from his normal position when was for his cup tea games midway through the season was generally very much defensive liability and did not show much offensively either although that may more indicative the lack ice time got those games may need another season work his defense but once his defense acceptable should ready michel picard season 1st acquired trade with hartford for yvon corriveau grade the year old picard although perennially tore the minors seems close being out chances for some reason after being acquired the sharks but failing impress the management games scoring goals for his only points and spent most the rest the way kansas city was not particularly strong defensively and despite his offensive brilliance the minors has failed thus far score the nhl although has been given limited opportunities may the sharks bait the expansion draft dody wood season 1st acquired 3rd round pick 1991 entry draft grade although perhaps shouldn give grade all have been accused knocking wood too much then probably surprise you that thoroughly unimpressed wood thus far although games small example was generally nonfactor offense was not particularly good defensively and took too many silly penalties losing many fights the process and gathering penalty minutes those games projecting 446 game season not ready and needs least another season where can work his fighting skills nothing else his relatively small size 181 lbs does not give much possibility that can survive this stage enforcer calgary flames macinnis for norris gary

may find relevant listmember asks what makes common law marriages wrong common law marriage not necessarily wrong itself there nothing the bible old new testament about getting married preacher priest jewish christian and fact jewish priests have never had any connection with weddings there common notion that the marriage performed the clergyman fact the traditional christian view least the west that the bride and groom are the ministers the marriage and that the clergyman there only witness however the essential ingredient marriage mutual commitment two persons are considered married and only they have bound themselves mutual promises live together husband and wife forsaking all others till death them part the reason why those who have reason concerned about who married whom have always insisted some kind public ceremony order that society and the couple themselves may clear about whether commitment has been made suppose that away with the public ceremony the standard vows etc instead have man and woman settling down live together after year the man says the woman hey honey was great while lasted but think time move she says what are you talking about says leaving you and looking for someone prettier and younger she says but you can are married says what are you talking about never got married she says remember distinctly what you said the night first made love you said love for you deep the ocean eternal the stars long live yours utterly and completely when lie deathbed last feeble breath will utter your name says that that was just rhetoric just poetry when man romantic mood bound say all kinds silly things like that you mustn take them literally and that why you have insistence formal ceremony that matter public record the church insists because her duty among other things give moral advice and you cannot give man moral advice about his relations with woman you have idea who married whom anybody and vice versa the state insists since the state has concern with property rights with child care and support and therefore needs know who has made what commitments whom prospective fathers law insist because they don want their daughters seduced and abandoned prospective spouses insist because they want make sure they know whether what they are hearing real commitment just poetry and persons making vows themselves insist making them formally and publicly order that they may clear their own minds about what that they are doing and may know themselves that this not just rhetoric this the real thing hence the insistence formal public explicit avowal the marriage commitment the church goes further and insists that when christians marry clergyman shall present the wedding and record the vows behalf the church not because impossible have valid wedding without clergyman but order make sure that the couple understand what the christian teaching about marriage and that they are fact promising married christian sense the church also prefers standard marriage vow and wary letting couples write their own vows for much the same reason that lawyers prefer standard terminology when they draw will contract certain language has been repeatedly used wills and one can sure how the courts will interpret try say the same thing your own words and you may find that the probate judge interpretation them not all what you intended similarly the church prefers avoid endless debates about whether you are main squeeze and here for the long haul fact cover the same territory forsaking all others and till death part this topic has come the list before there any topic that hasn one listmember was asking couple love each other and are living together isn that marriage the eyes god eventually someone asked that case what their status they break that the moral equivalent getting divorce are they relationship that god forbids either them walk out the original questioner said good grief never thought that fact there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that someone who says don need piece paper ceremony front judge preacher order show that love each other trying have both ways have the advantages marriage plus the option changing his mind with minimum bother this point someone may say none this applies and mate are quite clear the fact that have assumed lifelong commitment for better worse forsaking all others till death part our case ceremony needed this reply would the reason for requiring driver license keep dangerous drivers off the road what wrong itself not the existence unlicensed drivers but the existence dangerous drivers however testing and licensing drivers obvious and reasonable means pursuing the goal reducing the number dangerous drivers the road therefore the state rightly makes and enforces such laws and you the citizen have positive moral obligation refrain from driving without license matter how much hotshot behind the wheel you think you are back the original question have listmember who knows couple who have been living together for around years asks what point did they stop fornicating and start being married answer the point any where they both definitely and

way our brains are wired lewis ignored the very real possiblity that natural selection could also favour altruistic behaviour and morality well indeed humans evolved better and better building and using tools they also became better killing each other logical necessity that evolution could only favour those who knew how use tools but not against one own people the bible reveals quite nicely that the morality the early jews was not beyond this simple set rules hold the people together under one god their god did not care much about people other nations the time the things were quite

senses can convey reliable information solipsism still logical possibility but not very likely one you are continuously mixing two different views the subjective point view which all share and objective point view _which does not exist_ any observer thinker any personal being has its own point view does not matter whether this point view result some physical events not does not cease subjective from non observers non point view values not exist neither does pain pleasure beauty love such things are inherently subjective once again god wants wives submit their husbands even make leap faith into the unknown wants punish don disagree with his morals not think morals come from any supreme being remove morals means the same than make zombie machine without single thought god gave morality judge but disagree with him not fault free replace morals cannot see what the point giving someone moral system which disagrees with one own and then get mad this god must schizophrenic all this being you have excluded yourself from any discussion values right wrong goood evil etc and cannot participate your opinion about the bible can have weight whatsoever neither can the opinion any god for that matter cannot understand why subjective opinion thing made matter any way less credible than opinion thing made something else bill take note absolute values must independent _any_ being

expensive and usually the property the military jammers are major violation the regulations the federal communications commission the usa driving technique and vehicle dynamics questions what are understeer and oversteer understeer and oversteer are terms describing the behaviour car while cornering near the limit limit adhesion that most drivers not normally drive hard enough for these terms descriptive the situations they encounter simply put they tell whether the car wants straight corner steer less understeer wants turn more corner oversteer understeer commonly designed into most production cars that untrained drivers inadvertantly traveling too fast won get into trouble understeer may also induced using too much throttle corner oversteer designed into some more performance oriented cars may induced lifting the throttle trailing throttle oversteer tto extreme cases lifting the throttle may induce much oversteer that the car reacts fishtailing spinning some technical details corner speed the tires the car will develop what are called slip angles the slip angle the angular difference between the direction that the car traveling and the direction that the steering wheel directing the car travel understeer the front wheels have greater slip angle than the rear wheels oversteer the rear wheels have greater slip angle than the front wheels what rev matched downshift when downshifting the engine must rotating faster the lower gear than was the higher gear however during downshift normally you declutch and lift your foot from the throttle the revs drop rather than increase rev matched downshift you blip the throttle before engaging the clutch that the engine will already the new speed this results much smoother and faster downshift what does heel and toe mean heel and toe technique used rev matched downshift while braking this normally challenging because you need the right foot for both the brake and throttle called heel and toe because you use one end the foot the brake and the other the throttle match revs for the downshift many modern cars this misnomer often you must use the ball the foot the brake and the right side the throttle note that some race car drivers will skip the clutch and just use the left foot the brake and the right foot the throttle accomplishing the same thing what double clutch downshifting while your right foot doing the above your left foot can one three things nothing declutch once declutch twice the reason for declutching twice match the speeds the two shafts the transmission the speed the engine this usually coupled with rev matching that while the engine neutral and the clutch engaged the throttle blipped and both shafts the transmission speed the procedure follows declutch move gearshift lever neutral engage clutch match revs declutch move gearshift lever next lower gear engage clutch this sounds like lot work but with practice becomes natural the problem that double clutching solves normally the function the synchronizers within the gearbox transmissions without synchros with very worn synchros double clutching makes much easier shift basically you double clutch well you are not using the synchros all this generally unnecessary street cars with synchros good condition what the numbers for acceleration from mile skidpad and slalom times the auto magazines really mean may they compared short not much the magazines want you believe and almost never more detail the acceleration numbers 60mph and mile times the may vaguely compared long they all come from the same source testing procedures vary much from magazine magazine that comparing road track number car driver number quite pointless keep mind too that the same variation applies from driver driver the street the driver major often the major part the equation skidpads vary and even they didn skidpad figures are really only tests the stickiness the stock tires they change radically when tire compounds change not make any assumptions about the comparative handling say two sports sedans based skidpad numbers this not suggest that skidpads are without value however skidpads are excellent educational tool driving schools they are simply limited value the comparison anything except tires slalom times are slightly more useful they test some small parts the automobile transient response however they are also heavily influenced the stock rubber the car and they not test many corners the car envelope they not tell you all you need know before making buying decision for example they don tell you what the rear end the car will road which suddenly goes off camber when car has adjustable suspension these tests are usually done the sport setting which may quite unsuitable for daily driving the list caveats could for page after page buddy claims that wide tires don make any difference according his freshman physics textbook and that you can ever accelerate corner more than does know what talking about short hasn got clue more detail the equations for friction used freshman physics textbooks presume that the surfaces are smooth dry and non deformable none which properly apply tire traction except the case stone cold tire dry pavement which far below its proper operating temperature pavement _never_ smooth always irregular greater lesser extent tires which are not really dry and solid rubber substance which its natural form liquid and which has only been coerced into semblance solidity chemical magic deform match the surface the pavement which vehicle traveling over tire operating temperature grip actually generated shear stresses inside the deformed rubber and not anything even remotely resembling friction the freshman physics sense the term the colder tire relative its operating temperature the closer its behaviour will the traditional concept friction much hotter than the its proper operating temperature the more likely the possibility some part the tire actually reverting liquid which mostly like happen deep the tread causing characteristic blisters and chunking this latter though almost completely unlikely happen normal street driving unless you competition driver lot high speed track driving don worry about because tire traction completely out the domain simple friction does not obey the freshman physics equation all thus dragsters accelerate more than and race cars corner and brake more than because simple friction does not apply actually possible for different sized contact patches generate differing amounts grip actual analysis tire behavior

fair amount new pointers information patents and stuff like that also reordered few things have more sensible ordering hope don have edit this again soon disclaimer nothing this faq should considered legal advice anything other than one layperson opinion you want real legal advice talk real lawyer preferably one with experience patent law export regulations whatever area law question list questions what ripem how can get ripem will ripem run machine will ripem work with mailer what rsa what des what fingerprint like md5 what pem what this about distributing and authenticating keys isn bad idea use patented algorithms standards like pem what about rsadsi pkp why all ripem public keys look very similar what pgp what about rpem what mime what tis pem have this simple way defeat the security ripem questions and answers what ripem ripem not yet complete but useful implementation privacy enhanced mail pem ripem allows your electronic mail have the four security facilities provided pem disclosure protection optional originator authenticity message integrity measures and non repudiation origin always see what pem ripem was written primarily mark riordan mrr scss3 msu edu most the code the public domain except for the rsa routines which are library called rsaref licensed from rsa data security inc the current version ripem the current version the macintosh port ripem how can get ripem ripem uses the library cryptographic routines rsaref which considered munitions and thus export restricted from distribution persons who are not citizens permanent residents the canada without export license such license has been obtained nor would one likely granted unless the rsa key exchange were shortened 512 bits and the symmetric cipher changed something weaker than des there are some suggestions that this situation may change now that clinton office the author requests the readme file that this law not violated please not export the cryptographic code this distribution outside the usa canada this personal request from the author ripem and condition your use ripem note that rsaref not the public domain and license for included with the distribution you should read before using ripem ripem available via anonymous ftp citizens and permanent residents the from rsa com rsaref and read the readme file for info note that the non rsaref portion ripem not product rsa data security incorporated they merely are helping distribute ripem well some other crypt stuff has its home site ripem msu edu which open non anonymous ftp for users the and canada who are citizens permanent residents find out how obtain access ftp there pub crypt and read the file getting_access for convenience binaries for many architectures are available here addition the full source tree will ripem run machine probably has already been ported dos and most flavors unix sunos next linux aix ultrix solaris etc ports macintosh include standard unix style port and rather nice mac like port written raymond lau author stuffit more ports are expected and help users invited will ripem work with mailer probably how easy and clean the effective interface will depend the sophistication and modularity the mailer though the users guide included with the distribution discusses ways use ripem with many popular mailers including berkeley mush elm and code also included elisp allow easy use ripem inside gnu emacs you make new interface for ripem create improvement one the distribution which you believe convenient use secure and may useful others feel free post alt security ripem what rsa rsa crypto system which asymmetric public key this means that there are two different related keys one encrypt and one decrypt because one cannot reasonably derived from the other you may publish your encryption public key widely and keep your decryption private key yourself anyone can use your public key encrypt message but only you hold the private key needed decrypt note that the message sent with rsa normally just the des key the real plaintext see what des note that the above only provides for disclosure protection for originator authenticity message integrity and non repudiation origin services implemented the fingerprint the message see what fingerprint like md5 encrypted with the sender private key the recipient dispute resolving authority can use the sender public key decrypt and confirm that the message must have come from the sender and was not altered rsa was named for the three men rivest shamir and adleman who invented find out lots more about rsa and modern cryptography general ftp rsa com and look pub faq some information also may sci crypt what des des the data encryption standard widely used symmetric secret key crypto system unlike rsa des uses the same key encrypt and decrypt messages however des much faster than rsa ripem uses both des and rsa generates random key and encrypts your mail with des using that key then encrypts that key with the recipient public rsa key and includes the result the letter allowing the recipient recover the des key des sometimes considered weak because somewhat old and uses key length considered too short modern standards however should reasonably safe against opponent smaller than large corporation government agency not likely that the pem standard will incorporate support for other symmetric ciphers the near future because there strong feeling that pem should stable can become utilized widely without early problems with interoperability what fingerprint like md5 md5 message digest algorithm produced rsa data security inc provides 128 bit fingerprint cryptographically secure hash the plaintext cryptographically secure because not possible reasonable amount computation produce different plaintext which produces the same fingerprint thus instead signing the entire message with the sender private key only the md5 the message needs signed for authentication md5s can also exchanged directly for authentication for example ripem public keys include md5 the public key the file parties wishing confirm their keys are authentic via separate channel merely need exchange md5s keys and verify their accuracy md5 sometimes used for other purposes for example often used map input arbitrary length 128 bits data passphrase interpreter cookie generator md5 described its entirety including implementation rfc 1321 there have been some recent suggestions that md5 may not strong hash was originally believed presumably some other hash function will used this accepted true what pem pem privacy enhanced mail standard for allowing transfer encrypted electronic mail generated over long period time working group experts described rfcs 1421 1424 these documents have been approved and obsolete the old rfcs 1113 1115 ripem not really complete implementation pem because pem specifies certificates for authenticating keys which ripem does not handle this time their addition planned what this about distributing and authenticating keys for remote user able send secure mail you she must know your public key for you able confirm that the message received came from her you must know her public key important that this information accurate bad guy convinces her that his key fact yours she will send messages which can read ripem allows for three methods key management central server the distributed finger servers and flat file all three are described the ripem users guide which part the distribution none them provide perfect security the pem standard calls for key management certificates the addition this feature ripem planned but chicken egg issues still exist isn bad idea use patented algorithms standards like pem this issue has been considered the standards process rfc 1310 the specification for internet standards has discussion section what specifications for nondiscriminatory availability must met for patented method included standard rfc 1421 addresses this issue with regard the patents covering public key cryptography this does not course mean that all questions are settled that everyone agreement interesting exchange the use patented algorithms standards with regard public key cryptography the league for programming freedom archive available via ftp ftp net doc lpf the files bidzos letter and bidzos response amusingly the lpf files ftp net are compressed with patented algorithm what about rsadsi pkp rsa data security inc rsadsi california based company specializing cryptographic technologies public key partners firm which holds exclusive sub licensing rights the following patents and all their corresponding foreign patents cryptographic apparatus and method diffie hellman 200 770 public key cryptographic apparatus and method hellman

for reason other than its author desire see widespread use public key cryptography however after the ball started rolling people rsadsi got interested rsadsi decided carry ripem its ftp site and some people there started making their own ripem keys and contributing code ripem even won the best application built rsaref 1992 award why all ripem public keys look very similar ripem public keys begin with pkcs public key cryptography standards identifier describing various characteristics about the key the first bunch characters your key may the same those lots other people keys this does not mean your keys are similar but only that they are the same class key were generated with the same program are the same length etc what pgp pgp another cryptographic mail program called pretty good privacy pgp has been around longer than ripem and works somewhat differently pgp not compatible with ripem any way though pgp does also use rsa few major differences between pgp and ripem pgp has more key management features particularly for users without direct network connection ripem conforms the pem rfcs and thus has greater probability working with other pem software pgp makes attempt compatible with anything other than itself ripem uses rsaref library rsa routines from rsadsi which comes with license allowing noncommercial use pgp uses its own implementation rsa pkp claims that violation its patents make use sell pgp the canada without either license written permission see disclaimer see what about rsadsi pkp phil zimmermann the author pgp stopped distributing after being threatened with legal action believed that licensing scheme could arranged but hasn happened and there seems little prospect happening the future acknowledges the pgp user guide fact you live the usa and you are not federal agency you shouldn actually run pgp your computer because public key partners wants forbid you from running software pgp contraband both pgp and ripem are export restricted and cannot sent outside the and canada without export license however pgp already exists many ftp sites europe and other places whether you use pgp ripem whatever the documentation pgp recommended reading anyone interested such issues unfortunately not distributed separately from the program which can difficult find the ftp sites due liability concerns what about rpem rpem stands for rabin privacy enhanced mail was similar ripem but used public key cipher invented rabin which not rsa attempt avoid the patents public key systems was written mark riordan who later wrote ripem its distribution was halted when contrary the beliefs many including rabin pkp claimed that their patents were broad enough cover the cipher employed this claim not universally accepted but was not challenged for pragmatic reasons rpem not really used anymore not compatible with ripem pgp what mime mime stands for multipurpose internet mail extensions and described rfc 1341 you can find out about the newsgroup comp mail mime faq exists how pem should interact with mime not yet entirely clear some people use the stopgap solution having mime type application ripem order send ripem messages mime ones hope some standards will emerge draft internet documents exist the matter what tis pem trusted information systems working version privacy enhanced mail for general availability last heard was rumored integrated into existing mail user agent rather than stand alone system and beta test don know much more than that have this simple way defeat the security ripem you may wish check the companion post ripem attacks which discusses some the more obvious attacks ripem security and what procedures will minimize the risk ripem main weak area probably key distribution

-1 |text from rws arizona edu ronald schmidt subject outlining spline surface keywords spline rasterization lines about year ago started work problem that appeared very simple and turned out quite difficult wondering anyone the net has seen this problem and hopefully some published solutions the problem draw outline surface defined two roughly parallel cubic splines for inputs the problem essentially starts with two sets points where each set points the edge object which treat two dimensional only extant between the edges but which exists three dimensional space draw the object fit cubic spline through the points each spline effectively computed sequence line segments approximating the curve each spline has equal number segments assume that the nth segment along each spline roughly but not exactly the same distance along each spline any reasonable measure take each segment along each spline and match the nth segment the opposing spline use the pair segments form two triangles which will filled color the surface depth sort the triangles take each triangle sorted order project onto pixmap draw and color the triangle take the edge the triangle that along the edge the surface and draw line along that edge colored with special edge color the edge coloring step that the heart the problem the idea effectively outline the edge the surface the net result however generally has lots breaks and gaps the edge the surface the reasons for this are fairly complicated they involve both rasterization problems and problems resulting from the projecting the splines anything about this problem sounds familiar would appreciate knowing about other work this area thanks
